## Introduction

Middlewares are executed before the route handler. They can be used to modify the request or response object.

## Usage

To use a middleware, you can create `middleware` folder.

<Files>
    <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="midldeware" defaultOpen>
            <File name="logger.ts" />
        </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <File name="kurogashi.config.ts" />
    <File name=".gitignore" />
</Files>

They are similar to routes. Each file in the folder is a middleware.

```ts title="src/middleware/logger.ts"
import { defineEventHandler } from 'kurogashi';

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    console.log('Request:', event.req);
});
```

<Callout title="Middleware Execution" type="warn">
    Middleware doesn't have a `next` function.
    Execution moves to the next middleware when the current one finishes or sends a response.
    Sending a response stops further execution.
</Callout>

## Filtering

By default, all middlewares are executed on every request. You can filter them by using `url`

```ts title="src/middleware/logger.ts"
import { defineEventHandler, getPathname } from 'kurogashi';

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    const pathname = getPathname(event)

    if (pathname.startsWith('/api')) {
        console.log('Request:', event.req);
    }
});
```

## Order

Middlewares are executed based on the directory listing. You can control the order by renaming the files.

<Files>
    <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="midldeware" defaultOpen>
            <File name="00-logger.ts" />
            <File name="01-auth.ts" />
        </Folder>
    </Folder>
</Files>
